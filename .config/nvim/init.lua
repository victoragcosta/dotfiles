		Next, run AND READ `:help`.
		This will open up a help window with some basic information
		about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

		This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
		with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

		MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
		which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

	I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
		These are hints about where to find more information about the relevant settings,
		plugins or Neovim features used in Kickstart.

	 -NOTE: Look for lines like this

		Throughout the file. These are for you, the reader, to help you understand what is happening.
		Feel free to delete them once you know what you're doing, but they should serve as a guide
		for when you are first encountering a few different constructs in your Neovim config.

If you experience any errors while trying to install kickstart, run `:checkhealth` for more info.

I hope you enjoy your Neovim journey,
- TJ

P.S. You can delete this when you're done too. It's your config now! :)
